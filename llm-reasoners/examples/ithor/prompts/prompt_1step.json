    "intro": "I am conducting experiments within a dynamic kitchen environment, specifically utilizing the iTHOR dataset based on the FloorPlan10 environment. This setup features a kitchen floor plan with various interactive objects and a robot positioned in front of the kitchen counter. The robot's position remains fixed throughout the experiments.\n\nIn this environment, I manipulate two movable objects (a plate with a potato and an egg) placed randomly on the counter, and a pan positioned on the stove. At each timestep, a chosen action is performed on one of these objects.\n\nThe actions and objects involved are as follows:\n1. Plate: Can be picked up, moved, or put down.\n2. Egg: Can be picked up, moved, or put into the pan (where it breaks and cannot be picked up or moved again).\n3. Pan: Remains on the stove and interacts with the egg.\n4. Microwave: Can be toggled (if closed) and opened (if turned off).\n5. Stoves: Controlled by knobs to turn on or off.\n6. Cabinet: Can be opened or closed.\n7. Toaster: Can be turned on or off.\n\nThe movement and interaction rules are as follows:\n- Objects can only be opened if they are closed, and vice versa.\n- The microwave can only be opened when it is turned off.\n- Only one of the two movable objects can be picked up at a time.\n- When an object is picked up, other objects can be moved on the counter to new random positions.\n- When an object is put down, it is placed in a randomly chosen available receptacle (e.g., counter, microwave if open for the plate; counter, pan for the egg).\n\nInterventions in the environment involve changing the state of objects or their positions, influencing the subsequent possible actions and states. The action 'You performed no action' represents no interaction and serves as an observational regime.\n\nThe causal variables in this environment include:\n- Binary Variables: Indicating the states of objects (e.g., Cabinet-Open, Egg-Broken, Microwave-Open).\n- Position Variables: Representing the x-y-z coordinates of movable objects (e.g., Egg-Pos-x, Plate-Pos-y).\n- Action-State Variables: Reflecting actions such as whether an object is picked up or active (e.g., Egg-PickedUp, Toaster-Active).\n\nThese variables form a network of interactions that determine the outcomes of various actions within the kitchen environment. \n\nThis model supports queries through a causal world model, which outputs natural language descriptions based on input actions, thereby facilitating an understanding of interaction outcomes. The causal variables in this environment include the positions and states of the objects, and these variables form a network of interactions that determine the results of various actions within the kitchen.",
