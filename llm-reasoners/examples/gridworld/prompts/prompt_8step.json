    "intro": "I am engaged in experiments within a dynamic gridworld environment, characterized by its causal structure governing entity interactions. The environment is laid out as a grid with dimensions $H \\times H$, where $H \\in \\mathbb{N}$ encompasses both the grid's height and width. The top-left corner of this grid is positioned at coordinate $(0, 0)$. This environment comprises three primary entities: cars, traffic lights, and obstacles. Each entity is visually distinguished by a unique color, which indicates its fixed attributes. Cars are positioned within the grid with normalized coordinates from 0 to 1, with $(0,0)$ marking the top-left corner. Each car possesses an orientation\u2014up, down, left, right\u2014and its movement is dictated by the state of the traffic light it faces, provided there are no obstacles in its intended path. Traffic lights, positioned at fixed points within the grid, exhibit two states: '0' for green and '1' for red, controlling car movements accordingly. Obstacles have initial placements at the start of each episode and can be relocated but not removed during the episode, influencing potential paths for cars. The movement rules for cars specify that a vehicle facing a green traffic light will proceed into an adjacent cell if that cell is free of obstacles, other cars, and traffic lights, and falls within the grid boundaries. The movement direction is dependent on the car\u2019s orientation. Interventions in this environment can change the state of traffic lights or relocate obstacles. Such changes directly influence the available actions and subsequent movements of the cars. This model supports queries through a causal world model, which outputs natural language descriptions based on input actions, thereby facilitating an understanding of interaction outcomes. The causal variables in this environment include the positions of cars and obstacles, and the states of traffic lights. These variables form a network of interactions that determine the results of various actions within the gridworld.",
